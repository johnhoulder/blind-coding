# Blind Coding
Welcome to the blind coding challenge. This aims to help you learn and boost your confidence in code as well as entertain those watching.

## How it works
This is intended to work via streams rather than in-person but can easily be used for both. 

The idea is that you, the developer, work through a template to create a HTML site from it. You can use any technologies you want or need and you can either stop at building a static page or go further and implement Javascript, etc.

The viewers are able to see both your code and the resulting page in real-time. They are not allowed to give you hints however.
